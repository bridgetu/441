# HW-10:FINAL README for Bridget Unterreiner

Woahhhhhhhh what a semester! I learned an incredible amount... including the fact that I have so much more to learn!

This final assignment was a really sweet way to end a brain-melting semester. I was excited with the opportunity to create a "portfolio" site. With job hunting on the horizon, I've been wanting to put together a basic site to showcase some of my work. This assignment provided me with the perfect opportunity to do so while also providing me with the chance to put my learned skills to practical use.  

Happy Summer!
