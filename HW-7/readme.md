# README for HW-7 by BRIDGET UNTERREINER

This assignment was extremely frustrating!! I got caught in many rabbit holes and had to figure out how to effectively escape. I was specifically challenged with integrating buttons into my dynamic story structure. As a result of overcoming several obstacles during my process my code became somewhat cluttered and disorganized. 

Aside from some "technical difficulties" I really enjoyed the creative planning phases of the process. I was prompted to write a story based on my recent trip to Berlin. I had fun brainstorming a story and envisioning it as a functioning site. The site design was directly inspired by the German flag and it ended up providing a solid format for my content to fall into. 

I would have liked to embellish my site more, however the programming aspect of this assigment was so time consuming and complicated that adding decorative design elements would have further complicated things to a point in terrible inefficiency. 

Overall, I am extremely happy with how the site and story turned out.
