            <p>You and your friend, Olivia, are traveling to Berlin. You have made arrangements to stay with her close childhood friend, Stella, who has recently moved to Berlin from Columbus, Ohio to teach English there for the year.</p>
            <p>Stella has agreed to meet you and Olivia and the airport upon your arrival.</p>
            <p>The two of you are ecstatic to see Stella and looking forward to partying it up in Berlin… but are also broke college students who are traveling on a budget...</p>
            <p>She tells us that we’ll be taking a bus to the U-bahn (the city’s underground train), and then riding that the rest of the way until we reach her apartment. She encourages us to buy a public transportation pass before we board the bus, but also tells us that there is a chance that we will never be asked to show it, so it’s up to us if we want to spend the money on one or not. However, on the off-chance we are asked to show it, and we decided not to buy one, we will be forced to pay a hefty fine.</p>
            <p>So… do you spend the money upfront and buy the pass? Or… do you save the money and hope you don’t get caught?</p>
