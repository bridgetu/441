# HW-6 Readme for BRIDGET UNTERREINER

I was excited to bring things "back down to earth", so to speak, this week with a more practical application of the javascript skills we've been working on. Seeing our code represented as a physical webpage was rewarding and placed things in a context that allowed me to understand javascript in a deeper sense. 

I definitely struggled with removing the child nodes from the DOM... but once I overcame this obstacle things began to make more sense. 

Not being allowed to style my page using HTML or CSS was limiting and frustrating, but I am happy enough with my site's aesthetic considering the limitations. I aimed for an overall visual that complemented my site content.
