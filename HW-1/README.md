## TOOLS

### I took this assignment as an opportunity to utilze some helpful tools. 

### I utilized a website called [PLACEHOLD.IT](http://www.placehold.it) to help me lay out my site in the beginning stages before inserting and resizing my personal images!

### I also used [SVGENERATION.COM](http://www.svgeneration.com/recipes/Diagonal-Stripes/) to create the striped graphic for my hero image!

## MY FINAL THOUGHTS ON HOMEWORK !

### This assigment felt good. It was a reminder of all that I've learned thus far... but also a reminder that I still have so much to learn. I'm both nervous and excited for the rest of the semester!
