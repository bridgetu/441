                        In the spring of 2017, Bridget started Blumen Haus, a freelance floral design business that operates out of a home studio and provides floral services to clients who are looking for unique arrangements for their homes, offices, special events, etc. Blumen Haus was born out of a passion for all things floral and the desire to create! Bridgetâ€™s interest in floral design started when she spent a summer interning at a floral shop in Whitefish, MT. She returned to New York City that fall for school and felt herself missing the world of floral design. So, she began working at a floral shop in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She worked there until her eventual move back to Montana. She spent the next summer working at a flower garden in Kalispell, MT. The next spring, Blumen Haus became a reality. Bridget aims to incorporate bold shapes, varied textures, contrasting colors, and unconventional materials in her work to provide her clients with one-of-a-kind arrangements.                 </p>
