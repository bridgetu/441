# HW-3 Readme for BRIDGET UNTERREINER

I really enjoyed this week. It challenged me in completely new ways. In addition to testing my coding skills, it tested my ability to think critically and logically.

I was frustrated at first, because I was having a difficult time wrapping my head around the "puzzles" we were tasked with finding solutions to... but once I broke through the confusion, the results were rewarding.

After completing these exercies, I'm beginning to understand javascript's purpose and possibilities.
