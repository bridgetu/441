# HW-4 Readme for BRIDGET UNTERREINER

Wow. This week's excercises were truly a test of my patience and ability to problem solve. This specific coding language definitly doesn't come naturally to me. Its formulaic and slightly mathematical nature is fairly intimidating. Javascript is surely something that I'll only begin to grasp with practice... practice... and more practice...

However, I did start to feel like I was grasping a stronger mental hold on the different functions and their abilities... but definitely still working on grasping exactly how to apply them! 

Problem #5 was extremely tricky and plenty of research and trial-and-error to solve. I struggled with applying the arrow function.
