# HW-9 README for Bridget Unterreiner

This week was super fun!! I cherised the freedom that this assignment allowed and was excited with the opportunity to create a site that addressed personal needs/interests. 

At first, I had a grand plan to create a 'album review' site that studied XXXtentacion's (one of my favorite current rap artists) most recent ablum "?" utilizing either the Soundcould or Spotify API. However, both of these platforms proved to be a bit tricky and confusing to work with so I decided to reformulate my approach. 

I ended up finding an amazing lyric database platform instead and was inspired to create a site that featured a lyric search feature. I was able to easily incorporate this API's data into my site's aesthetically curated interface easily and I am really happy with the result. 

Most importantly, the site I created is something I would realistically utilize in my everyday life.
